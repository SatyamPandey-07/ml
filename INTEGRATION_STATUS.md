# 🎯 INTEGRATION SUMMARY

## Overall Integration Score: **76.5%**

### ✅ What's Fully Integrated (100%)

**🌐 Frontend ↔ Backend Integration:**
- ✅ All 15 model features exposed in web UI
- ✅ Smart input types: dropdowns for categorical, numbers for numerical  
- ✅ Real-time predictions with probability scores
- ✅ Model metrics dashboard (F2-score, recall, precision, threshold)
- ✅ Sample data loading from training set
- ✅ RESTful API endpoints for programmatic access
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback

**⚙️ ML Pipeline Components:**
- ✅ Feature detection (keyword patterns)
- ✅ Feature engineering (aggregations)
- ✅ Categorical encoding (OneHotEncoder)
- ✅ Numerical scaling (StandardScaler)
- ✅ Imbalanced data handling (SMOTE)
- ✅ Model training (RF/LightGBM/XGBoost)
- ✅ Threshold optimization (F2-score)
- ✅ Model calibration (CalibratedClassifier)
- ✅ Prediction pipeline
- ✅ Web interface

### 📊 Data Utilization: **29.4%**

**✅ Used Features (15/51):**
```
📊 Numerical (7):
  • repayment_mean, repayment_median, repayment_std
  • consumption_mean, consumption_median  
  • utilization, repeat_loan_count

🏷️ Categorical (8):
  • gender, education_level, employment_status, business_type
